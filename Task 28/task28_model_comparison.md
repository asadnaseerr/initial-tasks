- **Model Modification**: Difficult to modify converted models
- **Conversion Required**: Extra step needed from training framework
- **Operator Support**: Some PyTorch operations may not convert perfectly

## Performance Metrics

Based on typical conversion results:

- **Inference Speed**: ONNX is typically 1.5x to 3x faster than PyTorch
- **Memory Usage**: ONNX uses 20-40% less memory during inference
- **File Size**: ONNX files are 25-50% smaller than equivalent PyTorch models
- **Startup Time**: ONNX models load 2-3x faster

## Use Case Guidelines

### Choose PyTorch (.pt) when:
- You are actively researching or developing new models
- You need to frequently modify model architecture
- You require training capabilities
- You're working exclusively in Python
- Debugging and experimentation are primary concerns
- You're in academic or research environments

### Choose ONNX (.onnx) when:
- You are deploying to production systems
- You need cross-platform compatibility
- You're building mobile or web applications
- Performance and efficiency are critical
- You're working with multiple programming languages
- You're deploying to edge devices or embedded systems
- Long-term model maintenance is important

## Conversion Process

The typical workflow is:
1. **Develop and train** model in PyTorch (.pt)
2. **Convert** to ONNX format for deployment
3. **Validate** that outputs are numerically equivalent
4. **Deploy** the ONNX model to target platforms

## Hardware Support

**ONNX Runtime Providers:**
- CPU Execution Provider
- CUDA Execution Provider (NVIDIA GPUs)
- TensorRT Execution Provider
- OpenVINO Execution Provider (Intel)
- CoreML Execution Provider (Apple)
- NNAPI Execution Provider (Android)
- DML Execution Provider (DirectML)

## Verification

After conversion, always verify:
- Outputs are numerically equivalent (differences < 1e-6)
- Model produces expected results on test data
- Performance meets deployment requirements
- All required operations are supported

## Conclusion

**PyTorch (.pt)** excels in flexibility and development speed, making it perfect for research and prototyping. **ONNX (.onnx)** shines in performance and portability, making it ideal for production deployment. The optimal approach is to use PyTorch for development and convert to ONNX for deployment, leveraging the strengths of both formats.

**Bottom Line**: Develop in PyTorch, deploy in ONNX.
