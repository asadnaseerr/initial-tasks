# Vision Transformers (ViT): A Technical Report

## Abstract
Vision Transformer (ViT) is a groundbreaking architecture that adapts the Transformer model, originally designed for natural language processing, to computer vision tasks. By treating images as sequences of patches and leveraging self-attention mechanisms, ViT demonstrates that convolution-free, pure transformer architectures can achieve state-of-the-art performance on image classification benchmarks when pre-trained on large datasets.

## Introduction

Traditional computer vision has been dominated by Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) since the breakthrough of AlexNet in 2012. CNNs leverage inductive biases like translation equivariance and locality through their convolutional layers. The Vision Transformer challenges this paradigm by applying the transformer architecture, which has revolutionized natural language processing, directly to image patches without convolution operations.

## Background

### Transformers in NLP
The Transformer architecture, introduced in "Attention Is All You Need" (Vaswani et al., 2017), relies on self-attention mechanisms to process sequential data. Key components include:
- **Self-Attention**: Computes relationships between all elements in a sequence
- **Multi-Head Attention**: Multiple attention heads capture different relationship types
- **Positional Encoding**: Injects information about token positions
- **Feed-Forward Networks**: Applied position-wise

### Limitations of CNNs
While CNNs have been successful, they face challenges:
- Limited receptive field in early layers
- Fixed weight sharing patterns
- Difficulty capturing long-range dependencies
- Handcrafted architectural choices

## Architecture Overview

The ViT architecture can be divided into three main stages:

1. **Patch Embedding**: Convert image to sequence of patch embeddings
2. **Transformer Encoder**: Process sequence through multiple transformer layers
3. **Classification Head**: Generate final predictions

```
Input Image → Patch Embedding → Transformer Encoder → MLP Head → Output
```

## Core Components

### 1. Patch Embedding

**Process:**
- Input image: `H × W × C` (Height × Width × Channels)
- Split into `N` patches of size `P × P × C`
- Flatten patches: `N × (P²·C)`
- Project to embedding dimension `D` using linear projection

**Mathematical Formulation:**
```
Patch Embedding = Linear(Flatten(Patches))
```
Where `N = (H × W) / P²` is the sequence length

### 2. Position Embeddings

Since transformers are permutation-invariant, positional information must be explicitly added:

**Options:**
- **1D Learnable Embeddings**: Most common in ViT
- **2D Learnable Embeddings**: Capture spatial relationships
- **Sine-Cosine Embeddings**: Fixed positional encoding from original transformer

### 3. Class Token

Inspired by BERT's [CLS] token:
- Prepend a learnable classification token to the patch sequence
- Final hidden state of this token serves as image representation
- Enables standard transformer architecture without modification

### 4. Transformer Encoder

The encoder consists of L identical layers, each containing:

**Multi-Head Self-Attention (MSA):**
```
Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QKᵀ/√d_k)V
MultiHead = Concat(head₁, ..., head_h)Wᵒ
where head_i = Attention(XWᵢ_Q, XWᵢ_K, XWᵢ_V)
```

**Layer Normalization:** Applied before each sub-layer (Pre-Norm configuration)

**MLP Block:** Two layers with GELU activation
```
MLP(X) = GELU(XW₁ + b₁)W₂ + b₂
```

## Working Principle

### Step-by-Step Processing

1. **Input Preparation**
   ```
   Input: Image ∈ R^(H×W×C)
   Patches: X_p ∈ R^(N×(P²·C)) where N = HW/P²
   ```

2. **Embedding Generation**
   ```
   X_0 = [x_class; x_p¹W; x_p²W; ...; x_p^NW] + E_pos
   Where:
   - W ∈ R^((P²·C)×D) is patch embedding matrix
   - E_pos ∈ R^((N+1)×D) is position embedding
   - x_class is learnable class token
   ```

3. **Transformer Processing**
   ```
   X'_l = MSA(LN(X_(l-1))) + X_(l-1)        // Residual connection 1
   X_l = MLP(LN(X'_l)) + X'_l               // Residual connection 2
   for l = 1...L
   ```

4. **Classification**
   ```
   y = LN(X_L⁰)                            // Use class token
   Output = MLP_Head(y)
   ```

### Self-Attention Mechanism

The self-attention mechanism allows each patch to attend to all other patches, enabling global receptive field from the first layer:

```
# For a single head
Q = XW_Q, K = XW_K, V = XW_V
Attention = softmax(QKᵀ/√d_k)V

# This computes weighted sums where weights are
# determined by similarity between queries and keys
```

## Key Variations and Improvements

### 1. DeiT (Data-efficient Image Transformers)
- Introduces distillation token
- Knowledge distillation from CNN teacher
- Requires less data and computational resources

### 2. Swin Transformer
- Hierarchical architecture
- Shifted window attention for efficient computation
- Linear computational complexity with image size

### 3. Hybrid Architectures
- Combine CNN feature maps with transformer
- Use CNN backbone for patch embedding

## Performance Analysis

### Advantages
1. **Global Context**: Self-attention provides global receptive field
2. **Scalability**: Performance improves with more data and larger models
3. **Parallelization**: Better parallel processing than sequential CNNs
4. **Transfer Learning**: Strong performance on downstream tasks

### Limitations
1. **Data Hunger**: Requires large-scale pre-training (JFT-300M)
2. **Computational Cost**: Quadratic complexity with sequence length
3. **Spatial Inductive Bias**: Less built-in spatial awareness than CNNs
4. **Training Instability**: Can be sensitive to hyperparameters
